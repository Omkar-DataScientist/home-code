The above code is wrong, I need to get profiles suggested for my keyword eg :Bigdata , Data science, AI engineer etc., searching from linkedin or Naukri when passed the link. So it should ask for the Link for Naukri , Linkedin , And ask for the Requirement. Based on the requirement it should go and search the profiles and then suggest the right profiles matching the requirement
